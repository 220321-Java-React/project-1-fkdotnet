# Employee Reimbursement System

A simple full-stack implementation of an Employee Reimbursement System that tracks Employee spending. 

## Description
This is a small project, scalable to much more tracking. Time is kept in Local, and rendered to the employee Panel.

## Getting Started
Create a database in line with that in the code, and run the Javalin app. The frontend can be hosted, and used to login!
Employees can:
Submit requests, and refresh the page

Managers can:
Approve, or deny requests
submit their own requests

### Dependencies
Java 8, a web host for the front end, PostgreSQL, the Bootstrap, and external CDN's should be within those copies heads!
